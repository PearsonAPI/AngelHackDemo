=============

Simple single-page web app to demonstrate using the Pearson Dictionaries API. 

Setup
-----

Edit the js/dictionaryExample, and locate the line near the top:

    this.apikey = 'your_api_key'

Change this to use the apikey from your developer.pearson.com account (sandbox or production).

Save the file.

Running
-------

Open the index.html file in a browser. You will need to use the right-arrow to move to the second page,
and then use the down-arrow to reveal the input box. Simple enter the word you are looking for, and 
the data should appear in the window.

Click on any entry to expand for more details. 

Items with a 'sound' icon next to them will play a sound when clicked.
